# Portfolio Hedging Effectiveness of Rare Earth Elements

## Abstracts

Portfolio hedging instruments refer to financial tools that are used to protect against risk, particularly the risk of price fluctiations in e.g. stocks, assets and currencies. Tedeschi (2025) shows that rare earth elements (REEs) used to be effective hedges; however, their effectiveness has been diminished due to market votality and geopolitical instability. Tedeschi used financial data until early October 2024.

We investigate whether this finding continues to hold using newly available data until the end of June 2025.
